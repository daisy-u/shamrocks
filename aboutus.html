I graduated from UTSA this past summer 2020 with a Bachelor’s degree in Management. While at UTSA I was a member of a Jewish fraternity, Alpha Epsilon Pi where I helped grow the organization from 5 members to 14 members when I graduated. I have always had a passion for working with and around people and my work history reflects that. I worked as a summer camp counselor for four summers (which was the same summer camp I spent a few summers as a camper too) as well as working sporadically for a private bartending business working weddings, parties and other events. Currently I am working through the MBA program at UHCL with a projected graduation date of Fall 2021. After graduation I plan to work in the hospitality industry in some fashion. </p>

                    <p class="card-text">BIO: I am Nigerian-American and I have lived in Houston since I was a teenager. I am the second girl and third child out of four kids. I finished high school at 16 back home in Nigeria but due to politics and corruption, I was unable to be matched with the University program I wanted, so my mom brought my siblings and I to the States. Although I had a high school diploma, I was unable to attend college until I turned 18, so I spent my first year in America teaching myself how to drive, earning certifications and working as a Certified Nursing Assistant in a nursing facility. Fast-forward a few years and many bumps in the road, I obtained my Licensed Vocational Nursing certification and eventually my Bachelor's degree in Nursing. Currently, I'm working as a travel operating room nurse in California and I love the freedom of traveling. However, I wish to make a career switch by 2022 to software development and I try to hone my programming skills and challenge myself in any way that I can. I joined this MBA program because it is primarily online and an MBA is a very flexible degree that can advance me both in nursing and in information technology. </p>
